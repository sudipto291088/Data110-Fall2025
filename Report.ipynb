    "Future modeling could test Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to capture nonlinear salary influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research could explore time-based data (e.g., salaries by year) to track market evolution.\n",

    "Adding company size and remote work variables could improve predictive strength.\n",

    "Overall Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The EDA revealed a clear structure in the 2021 data science job market:\n",
    "high-rated companies and tech-centric industries offer the best compensation,\n",
